Each speaker and podcast participant has a file with some generic information in it:

the files can be found in the `data/people` direcotry and they are listed on this page:
https://codeandtalk.com/people

The fields that we try to collect are as follows:

```
name:        Full name
twitter:     Just the username
github:      Just the username
home:        URL of the home page
country:     Actually    city, state, country
```

If the person does not have one of twitter/github/home then we put a - as the value to indicate
that. No value, or no field means we could not find or never tried to look for those values.

Some of the files have extra fields. We'll describe those later on.
