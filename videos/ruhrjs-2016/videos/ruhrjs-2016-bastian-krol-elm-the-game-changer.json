  "description": "In this talk I will make the point why Elm changes the way you develop web applications thoroughly and for the better.\n\nElm is a functional reactive programming language that compiles to JS. Elm makes it easy to use the FRP style to build anything from simple websites to complex interactive applications in a clean and beautiful manner. The language focuses on developer happiness to make web development a delightful experience. Runtime errors just do not happen - ever! Thus you can focus on creating your app instead of hunting down bugs.",
