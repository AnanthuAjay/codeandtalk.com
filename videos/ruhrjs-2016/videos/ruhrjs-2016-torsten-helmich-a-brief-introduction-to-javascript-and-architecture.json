  "description": "JavaScript came a long way and has been evolved to a mature language that allows to build complex client-side applications. Building large enterprise applications, comes with the need for a closer look on to requirements and the subsequent architecture. Being showered with millions of frameworks, developers are often unsure which might be the best foundation for their software. This talk tries to give a slight overview about what are the keys to choose the right architecture and therefore hopefully satisfy their customer needs.\n\n+++ Sidenote: We talked to Torsten regarding using inappropriate language (guys) in his talk. He apologized directly after his talk for that. +++",
