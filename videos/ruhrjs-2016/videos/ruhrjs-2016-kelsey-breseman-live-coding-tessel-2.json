  "description": "Interested in IoT or hardware, but not sure where to start? This talk will give you the confidence and ideas to start building your own devices. Starting from a Node installation and a fresh Tessel 2, we'll run through a few projects of increasing complexity: blinking lights, getting online, collecting data, using that data, and even creating something you can control from the internet. All in 30 minutes, no prior hardware experience required.",
