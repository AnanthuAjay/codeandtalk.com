  <h2>What is this site?</h2>
  <p>
  A collection of ...
  <ul>
      <li>Upcoming Open Source and Technology related conferences.</li>
      <li>Video recordings from previous events.</li>
      <li>Podcasts about Open Source and Technology in general.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    To provide a place where people who are looking for speaking opportunities and people who would like to attend events
    can easily find what they are looking for.
  <p>
  <p>
    To make it easy for people who cannot attend events to find and watch presentations from previous events.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make it easy for Open Source and Tech conference organizers to list their events (it is just a <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/conferences">pull-request</a>).
  </p>
  <h2>Who</h2>
  <p>
  <a href="http://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a> runs the site, but given that both the source code and the data can be found on 
  <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/conferences">GitHub</a> anyone can easily contribute.
  </p>

  <h2>Contribute</h2>
  <p>
   The site seriously needs some design and more data. You can contribute events, and corrections to existing data.
   One of the most valuable contribution might be to add "topics" to the events and "tags" to the videos.
  </p>

  <h3>Podcast</h3>
  <p>
  If you'd like to see additional podcasts listed here, file a ticket or open a pull request.
