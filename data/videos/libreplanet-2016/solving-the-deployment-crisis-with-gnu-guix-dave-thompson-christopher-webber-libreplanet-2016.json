    "description": "By Dave Thompson and Christopher Allan Webber\n\nUser freedom is threatened by the growing complexity of current deployment and packaging directions. Running software (especially server/networked software) is becoming too hard for the average user, so many users are turning to the dangerous path of relying on large corporations to do their computing for them. What can GNU do to turn the tide here? Enter GNU Guix and GuixSD! This talk walks through Guix's unique positioning to provide totally free and reproducible systems. A path is laid out on how Guix could be used as a foundation to run and maintain computing for everyone, how you can get Guix and GuixSD running, and how to get involved in the most hacking-friendly package manager/distro duo ever!\n\nRecorded at LibrePlanet 2016 on March 19, 2016 in Cambridge MA. https://libreplanet.org/2016/\n\nModified from the original to interleave images of the slide deck.
