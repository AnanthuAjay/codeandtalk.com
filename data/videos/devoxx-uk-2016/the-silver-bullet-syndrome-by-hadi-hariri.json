  "description": "We love our silver bullets don\u2019t we? Constantly chasing the dream that the next big thing will solve all our past problems. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a language, framework, platform or library, we\u2019re out there chasing it. Why? Well because it\u2019s going to solve our needs, it\u2019s going to solve the business needs. Well supposedly it will. And how much is it going to cost? Not that much, especially if we\u2019re not the ones paying the bills. It\u2019s about time we look at the hard facts and ask those difficult questions. Are we really looking for a silver bullet? Why are we constantly riding the technology bandwagon? Where is the churn going to take us? And at what cost?",
