  "description": "Ray lived in a 180-sqft (~18m2) micro-studio near New York. It had no kitchen but it does come with free, but slow Wi-Fi. Ray's a Developer Advocate at Google and he travels a lot, often needs to build Docker images on the airplane, in coffee shops, or in hotels with unpredictable Wi-Fi. Learn how Ray adapted to working with large Docker images over slow Wi-Fi by utilizing Docker Machine, Google Cloud Platform, and a bunch of tips and tricks!\n\nThis strategy also saved Ray from numerous demoes - he once demoed Docker containers and Kubernetes by tethering to his colleagues' phone connection.",
