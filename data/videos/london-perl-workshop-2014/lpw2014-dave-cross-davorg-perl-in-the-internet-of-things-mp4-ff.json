    "description": "The Internet of Things is trendy and exciting. Surely a grungy old language like Perl is going to be of limited use in an area like this.\n\nThat's not true, of course. Perl is just as useful as other language. Perhaps more so.\n\nWe'll look at some Perl tools that you can use to ensure that your favourite objects are as well-connected to the internet as anyone else's.\n\nMost IoT interactions are just well-disguised HTTP transactions.
