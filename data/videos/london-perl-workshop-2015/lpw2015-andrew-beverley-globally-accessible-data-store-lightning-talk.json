    "description": "The Globally Accessible Data Store (GADS) is a configurable online database. It's designed to be a user-friendly database that can be configured and used by non-technical people. It allows tabular data to be stored and analysed, that might otherwise use a spreadsheet or bespoke application.\n\nThis talk is to introduce the software, so that it can be used by developers, who might otherwise be forced to develop a custom application.",
