This chaos makes its way right to our websites, filling them with crap users don't want, need, or sometimes even understand. We\u2019re practicing content strategy now, so what gives? Why are we still designing around all this clutter and corporate-speak? Because strategy documents and style rules alone won\u2019t make people actually produce content that meets users\u2019 needs and aligns with our designs. In this talk, you\u2019ll hear what will: embracing (okay, tolerating) content chaos, instead of anguishing over imperfections. You'll learn strategic approaches for defining meaningful content problems in your organisation\u2014and solving them one at a time.",
