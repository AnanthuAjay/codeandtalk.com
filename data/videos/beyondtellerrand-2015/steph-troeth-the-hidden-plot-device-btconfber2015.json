    "description": "Title: The Hidden Plot Device\n\nDescription:\n---------------\n\u201cStorytelling\" appears to be a magic word when it comes to creating user experience\u2014we use it to evoke design ideals, to summon the creative spirit, or to cry out for a narrative link across the complex world of devices and short attention span. But is this all there is?\n\nUnconvinced that storytelling could be so superficial, Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. As she uncovered the parallels in the making of stories and the research/design processes of UX, she began to formulate a framework where these two worlds meet, unearthing a different angle on what do in order to take our skills to greater heights.\n\nIn this session, Steph will show how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it\u2019s less of a mystery than what you might think.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/stephanie-troeth\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
