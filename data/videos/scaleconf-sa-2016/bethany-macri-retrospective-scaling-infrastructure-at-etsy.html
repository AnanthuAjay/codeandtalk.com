<a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> is an online marketplace that connects people across the globe to buy and sell handmade and vintage goods.
Founded in 2005 in Brooklyn, Etsy has grown rapidly.
As a result, Etsy has need to scale its infrastructure to serve its growing user-base as well as its developers.
<p>
In this talk, Bethany Macri, Core Platform Engineer at Etsy, will discuss three software projects that demonstrate how Etsy changed its infrastructure to scale and maintain high availability:
<ul>
   <li>a four-year data migration project</li>
   <li>writing a new API that allowed clients to fetch data concurrently, and</li>
   <li>scaling datasets infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
This talk will propose a model for scaling as well as discussing possible ways Etsy will continue to scale as it grows.
