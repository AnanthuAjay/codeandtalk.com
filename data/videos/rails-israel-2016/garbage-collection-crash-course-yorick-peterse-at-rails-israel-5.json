    "description": "Yorick Peterse\n\n\n\n\n\nMany programming languages manage their memory using a garbage collector, Ruby being one of those languages. Yet while this technique is so widely used few understand how it works, what the different flavours of garbage collection are, when to use which flavour, and so on. \nIn this talk we'll look at the different garbage collection algorithms, which ones are used by various popular programming languages (including Ruby) and how these algorithms can affect your applications.",
