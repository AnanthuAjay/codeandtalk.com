Homoiconicity (code as data, data as code) is one of the hallmarks of Lisp. Clojure, a Lisp-1 language, has this wonderful feature too. In this talk I will discuss about performance optimization techniques that leverage homoiconicity.
<p>
No discussion on performance optimization can happen without discussing performance benchmarking. In this talk I will show how to do comparative benchmarking while trying to find performance bottlenecks. I will then proceed to showing techniques on using Clojure's homoiconicity to optimize performance. I will also show how to discover latency breakup of any Clojure code in a waterfall-chart model using homoiconicity.
