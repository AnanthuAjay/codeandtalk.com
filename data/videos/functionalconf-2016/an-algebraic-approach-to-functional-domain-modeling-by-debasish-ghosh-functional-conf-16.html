Domain modeling is usually implemented using OO design. In this approach of "nouns-first" we design object hierarchies using subtyping to model the various elements of the domain. In this talk we will take a different approach using Scala:
<ol>
  <li>Start with focus on verbs first.</li>
  <li>Think how we can model domain behaviors using pure functions grouped within extensible modules.</li>
  <li>Use an algebraic approach towards evolution of modules,the algebra being composed of functions,types and laws.</li>
  <li>See how the domain algebra can be constructed from categorical structures like monoids, functors and monads</li>
  <li>Discuss how the functional patterns lead to compositionality - an extremely important quality that scales your domain model.</li>
<ol>
