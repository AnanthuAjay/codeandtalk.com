My employer has a successful suite of products that grew out of a monolithic app.
When the monolith was split into different products and services one particular service had requirements that were naturally met by  Erlang: distributed execution,  fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability.
I've been working on an implementation of this service that meets the above requirements while retaining the existing interface and features.
<p>
In this presentation, I'll explain how I've created a solution combining Erlang with an existing heterogeneous stack that includes the JVM (Java/Scala), R, Perl, Python, and Javascript.
The presentation is a summary of my  ongoing work on this solution, the key challenges I faced, their solutions, and the future road map for the project.
