JVM is one of the most widely used platforms and has attracted several languages. Though functional programming support is available through several languages, developers targeting JVM do not have an option that combines static typing with pure functional programming. Frege tries to address this space by providing a Haskell implementation on JVM. It comes with a good support for Java interoperability too.
<p>
I will be presenting this topic from the context of a developer targeting Java platform looking for pure functional programming options, not as a Haskell developer targeting JVM.
