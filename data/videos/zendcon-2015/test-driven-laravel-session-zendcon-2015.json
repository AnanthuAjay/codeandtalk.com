Test-driven development can be hard, and a lot of the \u201crules\u201d can often become a distraction from the real reasons you're writing tests in the first place.\n\nIn this talk, you\u2019ll find out what the real benefits of TDD are, what really makes code \u201cgood\u201d, and why testability shouldn\u2019t be your only yardstick for measuring code quality.\n\nAdam also shows some of the pitfalls of a \u201cpurist\u201d testing approach, and give you strategies you can use to test-first without sacrificing simplicity or expressiveness in your code.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever given up on testing because it seemed so hard to do everything \u201cby the book\u201d, this talk will feel like a breath of fresh air and give you the tools you need to start writing tests that really matter.",
