  "description": "Presented by Jeremy Lindblom. Guzzle is an HTTP client library in PHP that puts all the power of cURL at your fingertips. Part of cURL\u2019s power comes from its \u201cMulti\u201d interface, which allows you to make concurrent HTTP requests using non-blocking I/O. Guzzle's HTTP handler implementation abstracts the complexity of cURL Multi into a simpler experience using Promises and PSR-7. Learn how to use Guzzle to work with HTTP requests and web service APIs in an asynchronous way, potentially saving you time and increasing the throughput of your PHP applications and services.",
