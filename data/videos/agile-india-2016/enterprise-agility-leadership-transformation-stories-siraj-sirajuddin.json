  "description": "Enterprise Agile Transformation initiatives are BIG. Change at this scale of thousands is tough. \n\nThe Leaders and Executives involved in these initiatives are going through their own personal transformation. Change at this scale of one is equally tough. \n\nSiraj Sirajuddin (SPCT) has worked with hundreds of executives leading enterprise agile transformation initiatives. These are their stories of personal growth and individuation. We will hear how transformation at a personal level is the leverage for transformation at a collective level. We will also learn of unique methods that activate personal transformation for leaders who are ready to step into their leader persona but are unable to get that from traditional leadership training and coaching methods.\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org\nSlide and Other details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1481",
