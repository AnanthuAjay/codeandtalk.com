Although primarily designed and used for gaming on the go, the increased performance of open source handhelds like the Pandora and GPH Caanoo is opening doors to new uses for these powerful yet compact devices.\r\n\r\nThis talk will give an introduction to these devices; where they came from, what makes them tick and - most importantly - what you can do with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve's fascination with all things computer-related started in his early childhood and has since developed into a diverse career spanning more than 12 years. Starting out in software development, his professional interests gradually spread into systems administration and architecture. Complementary to his current role as Senior UNIX Engineer at Competa, Steve remains a keen programmer who enjoys contributing to open source projects in his spare time, in which he can also often be found tinkering with the various machines in his classic computer and game system collection.\r\n\r\nTalk: Open Source Handhelds",
