    "description": "Elegantly Produce and Consume Compiled Packages (babel, coffee-script, etc) - Benjamin Lupton, Bevry\n\n\"JavaScript production use to be as easy as publishing your source code, which worked across all environments, with a few minor tweaks. Consumption was as easy as downloading and requiring the package.\n\nThese days, code may be run anywhere, in all sorts of browsers, desktops, and devices, with varying capabilities, not always known by the producer. JavaScript has evolved, incorporating new features that save developers time, although not supported accross all possible environments - with requires either abstinence of time saving features, or reducing environment support, or compiling on the producer or consumer side, all of which is complex and difficult.\n\nEditions solves this problem elegantly in a standardised way. Producers produce their packages in their ideal configurations, then publish the package with multiple editions for the consumers to consume at their digression. Consumers are made aware of this through automated README updates, can select the exact edition that meets their exact needs - or by default, have the best edition for their environment loaded automatically. All the complexity of modern JavaScript publishing is solved, for the consumer and publisher.\"",
