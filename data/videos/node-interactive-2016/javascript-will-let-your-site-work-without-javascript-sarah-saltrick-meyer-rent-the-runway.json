    "description": "JavaScript Will Let Your Site Work Without JavaScript - Sarah Saltrick Meyer, Rent the Runway\n\nWhat does your site look like without JavaScript turned off? Are your users waiting for all your JavaScript to be delivered and rendered before they see anything interesting on your pages? Is your site heavy and slow, especially on mobile devices? Isomorphic JavaScript with Node can help. No matter what server-side language you currently use, you can render your HTML with JavaScript on the server before sending it down to your client. We will discuss how to seamlessly build serverside-rendered content into stacks using popular frameworks like React and Ember and the performance, stability, and UX benefits that come with it.",
