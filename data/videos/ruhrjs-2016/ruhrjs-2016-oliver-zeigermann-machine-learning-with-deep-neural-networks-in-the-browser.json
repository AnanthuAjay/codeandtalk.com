    "description": "Interested in Machine Learning and its latest hype Deep Neural Networks? Unfortunately, most libraries in that area have a Python interface that might be a tad hard to install or are not very accessible to a JavaScript developer. Additionally, you might be afraid of the math involved.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how Deep Neural Networks work - leaving out most of the math. I will also introduce a JavaScript framework that easily lets you experiment with Machine Learning.\"",
