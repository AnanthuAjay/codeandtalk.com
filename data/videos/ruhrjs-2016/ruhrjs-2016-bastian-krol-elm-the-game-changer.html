Elm is a functional reactive programming language that compiles to JS.
Elm makes it easy to use the FRP style to build anything from simple websites to complex interactive applications in a clean and beautiful manner.
The language focuses on developer happiness to make web development a delightful experience.
Runtime errors just do not happen - ever! Thus you can focus on creating your app instead of hunting down bugs.
