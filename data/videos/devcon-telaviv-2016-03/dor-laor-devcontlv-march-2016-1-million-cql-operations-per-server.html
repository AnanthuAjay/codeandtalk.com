CPU core counts continue to grow, along with the raw speed of networking and storage devices available on a modern system.
Software design approaches that were valid and safe even a few years ago are no longer sustainable.
On new hardware, the performance of standard workloads depends more on locking and coordination across cores than on performance of an individual core.
<p>
The team behind the <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM hypervisor</a> and the <a href="http://osv.io/">OSv unikernel</a> is moving up the stack.
The <a href="http://www.seastar-project.org/">Seastar</a> platform enables extreme high-throughput,
low-latency applications on Linux, and can make existing real-world workloads run completely asynchronously.
<p>
Seastar uses shared-nothing data structures that eliminate costly locking between CPUs, and a dedicated user-space TCP implementation that runs on DPDK.
These radical changes in the server design translate into 5X-10x performance gain while preserving all of the Cassandra goodies.
