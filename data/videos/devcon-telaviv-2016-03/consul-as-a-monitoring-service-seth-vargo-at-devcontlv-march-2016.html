There are two sides to monitoring - exposing problems with alerts and acting upon those alerts to find solutions to the exposed problem.
For exposing problems, users can define any script for <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> to intelligently check and report the health status of all nodes in a cluster.
These scripts could be as simple as returning a 200, or as complex as querying the load and query response time on a database server.
Other monitoring solutions already provide such functionality, but where Consul shines is in the second half of monitoring - automatic intervention to find solutions to problems without human operators.
<p>
Since Consul has built-in health checking, it not only notifies operators of a node or service failure, but automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy nodes.
Consul is also able to re-route traffic back to a troubled node, once the node reports it is healthy again.
In this way Consul pushes the existing paradigms of monitoring, making it much more than a simple notification system.
Rather it surfaces problems and solves them without human intervention. Don't worry about that pager going off in the middle of the night - rest easy with Consul.
<p>
This talk will cover many of the high-level features of Consul as they relate to monitoring. While this talk may seem deeply technical on the surface, it is aimed at a very large audience.
I will not discuss setup or installation of Consul, but I will demonstrate the Consul Web UI and command line.
There will be some commands/code on slides, but there will be no live demos.
<p>
One of the goals of this talk is to demonstrate the Consul is more than a traditional monitoring solution - it is a runtime for the modern datacenter.
Consul allows infrastructure to adapt to the changing needs of any environment.",
