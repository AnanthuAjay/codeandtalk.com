    "description": "Designing Socially Impactful Digital Experiences\n\nDescription:\n---------------\nCountless people in technology want to use their skills to help others. However, creating a digital product that improves society is harder than it sounds. The successful use of technology in new contexts requires more research, testing, and time than most would like to admit. Countless social good hackathons have been organized, yet many products created during these events fail to become anything more than a mention in a recap article.\n\nIn this talk, Catt will describe her process of creating SenseU, a mobile sex education game that utilizes a popular form of communication: instant messaging. Using her project as a case study, she will highlight ways that the current state of designing for social good can be improved. Attendees will learn ways that technology can successfully help others as well as tips for launching an interactive experience created for social good.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/catt-small\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
