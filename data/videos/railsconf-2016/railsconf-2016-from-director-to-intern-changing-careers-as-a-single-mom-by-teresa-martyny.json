  "description": "At the beginning of 2015 I was a Director in the non-profit sector, 13 years into my career. My days revolved around crisis intervention and violence prevention. I kept people alive and was well respected in my field. A mom of two, flying solo, people thought I was brave, stubborn... and a little insane... to step out on the ledge of career change. Come on out on the ledge and humble yourself with me. It'll make you a better engineer.",
