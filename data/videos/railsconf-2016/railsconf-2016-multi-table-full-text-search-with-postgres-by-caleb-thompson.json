    "description": "Searching content across multiple database tables and columns doesn't have to suck. Thanks to Postgres, rolling your own search isn't difficult. Following an actual feature evolution I worked on for a client, we will start with a search feature that queries a single column with LIKE and build up to a SQL-heavy solution for finding results across multiple columns and tables using database views. We will look at optimizing the query time and why this could be a better solution over introducing extra dependencies which clutter your code and need to be stubbed in tests.",
