  "description": "If you apply for a programming job, you may be asked to complete a take home code challenge, \"pair program\" with another developer, and/or sketch out some code on a whiteboard. A lot has been said of the validity and fairness of these tactics, but, company ethics aside, what if you just need a job? In this talk, I'll show you a series of mistakes I have seen in these interview challenges and give you strategies for avoiding them. I'll give recommendations for how you can impress the programmers grading your work and I'll tell you which rules you should bend in your solutions.",
