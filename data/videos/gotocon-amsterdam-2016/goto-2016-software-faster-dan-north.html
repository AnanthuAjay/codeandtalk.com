Dan North - Agile Troublemaker, Developer, Originator of BDD
<p>
Some teams are orders of magnitude more effective than others.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> famously described himself as "not a great programmer, but a good programmer with great habits".

<h3><q>Patterns of Effective Delivery</q></h3>
<ul>
  <li><q>If someone can't tell you where something doesn't apply, they don't understand it yet. Or they are selling you something.</q></li>
  <li>Patterns are for naming things that you see.</li>
  <li><q>Best Practices are for beginners. Patterns for advanced people.</q></li>
</ul>

<h3>Spike and Stabilize</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Spike is an experiment - timeboxed; it will be thrown away</li>
  <li><q>A Spike is like an "option" in the financial world. It gives us a right, but not an obligation.</q></li>
  <li><q>Test Driven Testing</q></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hair Trigger</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Ability of a team to deploy its own code</li>
  <li>This means the team can go quickly and it can also screw up quickly.</li>
  <li>If there is a requirement for multiple people to review the code that settles some of the legal issues this might create.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ginger Cake</h3>
<ul>
  <li><q>Ginger Cake: Like chocolate cake just with ginger.</q></li>
  <li><q>Copy-paste code to get start quickly. From code you know really well.</q></li>
  <li>Structured Ginger cake</li>
  <li>Behavioral Ginger cake</li>
  <li>Ginger cake is the opposite of DRY</li>
  <li><q>The dark side of DRY is coupling</q></li>
</ul>

<h3>Shallow Silos</h3>
<ul>
  <li><q>Silos are bad, cross-functional teams are good. No, there is spectrum.</q></li>
  <li><q>Small sub-teams with common stand-ups</q></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Burn the Ships</h3>
<ul>
  <li><q>Burn the Ships: Force your people to move forward by eliminating the way back.</q></li>
  <li>Set specific goals with specific dead-lines.</li>
</ul>

For a paradigm shift (e.g. moving to agile) you need 3 things:
<ul>
  <li>dead-line</li>
  <li>no other options (can't back out)</li>
  <li>information</li>
</ul>
