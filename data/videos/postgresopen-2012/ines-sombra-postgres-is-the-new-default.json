  "description": "Postgres' popularity is growing, and rightfully so: it's reliable, performant, and competes well with traditional (and expensive) enterprise databases like Oracle and SQL Server. A year ago, Postgres' presence in the Engine Yard stack was almost non-existent. Focused primarily on MySQL, we only provided an Alpha version of Postgres 8.3 -- our offering was not feature complete, did not support database slaves, and was already becoming outdated. With Postgres 9.0 released in 2010 and with 9.1 scheduled for September 2011, we found ourselves facing a difficult challenge: how to give customers a first-class Postgres experience while catching up. Come hear the story of how we overhauled Postgres provisioning and what we learned in the process of making Postgres a default database.",
