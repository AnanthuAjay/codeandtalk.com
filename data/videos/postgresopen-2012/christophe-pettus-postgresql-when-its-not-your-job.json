    "description": "In this DevOps world, developers are increasingly being asked to manage the database as well. In a few brisk minutes, we will talk about (nearly) everything you need to know to bring up, tune, and keep a PostgreSQL database health. We'll go over installation, basic tuning, backups, disaster recovery, and helpful tools and techniques.\n\nIt's a very rare startup these days that has a full-time DBA on staff; mostly, the developers are pressed into service to handle the database as well. In this talk, we'll present the survival skills required to manage your PostgreSQL database while trying to push the product out the door.\n\nWe'll cover:\n\n    Installation.\n    Basic tuning (it's easier than you think).\n    Performance, including things you must not do.\n    Backups and disaster recovery.\n    Helpful tools, tips and tricks.\n\nNo PostgreSQL experience required.",
