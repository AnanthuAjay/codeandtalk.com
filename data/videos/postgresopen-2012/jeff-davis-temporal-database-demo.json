  "description": "Walk through creating a temporal database in PostgreSQL, based on a true story! We'll use the latest features in 9.2 to represent some typical business needs with time as a central focus. The speaker will try to adapt to some reasonable change requests from the audience, so some chaos may ensue.\n\nManaging time effectively is a crucial business need, but basic SQL doesn't provide the necessary tools. Timestamps by themselves aren't good enough, we need ranges of time (available in PostgreSQL 9.2) to tame the complexity.\n\nEven more important is the need to adapt to changing requirements quickly without cascading consequences. Temporal constraints and simpler temporal queries can increase confidence when adapting.",
