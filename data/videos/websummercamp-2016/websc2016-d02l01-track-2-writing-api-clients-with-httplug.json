HTTPlug defines an interface for HTTP clients and provides adapters for existing clients like Guzzle, as well as a plugin system operating directly on PSR-7. This tool chain allows building API clients that do not depend on a specific HTTP client at all. This workshop by the two of the main authors of HTTPlug will cover: * Working with PSR-7 request and response * Using HTTPlug and the MessageFactory * Bootstrapping clients explicitly or with Puli * Using the PHP-HTTP plugin system * Strategies for writing an API client.",
