It has plenty of features and plugins, but if you don't get familiar with all the shortcuts and features it will slow you down. In this workshop I will demonstrate all the useful shortcuts and how to create new live templates which saves you plenty of keystrokes, encourage you to use good settings and how to share them with your team, and recommend the best plugins. After the workshop, you should definitely feel a productivity boost working with PhpStorm and should be able to concentrate on your code and not hassle with the IDE anymore.",
