  "description": "We tend to think of user interfaces and UX as designer concerns that do not apply to us. However, every time we write code to be used by others \u2014 or ourselves in the future! \u2014 we are creating a UI. A UI whose usability can be vastly improved by many UX principles, some tailored to code, others applying to every UI, ever. \n\nIn this light-hearted talk you will learn a ton of tips and tricks to improve your API design, distilled from Lea\u2019s experience of creating & managing dozens of successful open source projects with thousands of merged pull requests.",
