    "description": "JavaScript is not just for web apps! This talk looks at JavaScript as an artistic and visual programming language and serves as a primer on generative art. The audience will learn how to recreate one of Damien Hirst\u2019s Spot paintings and one of Piet Mondrian\u2019s Composition paintings in the browser. JavaScript is commonly used to manage interactivity, data, and application states. However, we will use masterpieces of modern art to illustrate JavaScript\u2019s potential to manipulate visual space, color and shape.",
