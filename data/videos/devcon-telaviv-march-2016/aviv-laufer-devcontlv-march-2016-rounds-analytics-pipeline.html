How do we collect analytics at <a href="https://www.rounds.com/">Rounds</a>.
We have build a pipeline that starts at the user mobile device and flows via our collecting servers (written in golang) until it is inserted into
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch cluster</a>.
We will share our experience and the journey that we have made until we reached our current system.
