Liquid, a Scalable deduplication filesystem.It is designed for storing the Virtual Machine Image storage and for the large scale Virtual Machine Deployment.It also provides other features like fast Virtual Machine cloning, on-demand fetching through network.\n\nAjax Crawler for Extracting Workflow of Web Applications in Python (Deepak Kushwaha) :\nModern Web Applications are very rich. Several techniques like Ajax are used. Traditional crawlers which scraps the content based on unique URLs are no more usable. Crawljax is one of the existing crawler which is being capable of crawling Web Applications with AJAX content. It is developed in Java. We have worked on similar lines as Crawljax and developed our own Ajax Crawler in Python using Selenium Python, Networkx,Beautiful Soup, matplotlib, xml, html parsers and other open source libraries for comparing HTML DOM tree. Our Crawler also produces State Workflow diagram at the end of Crawling Process. \n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/",
