Now, this is not a doom and gloom lecture.
Actually it is a talk about what is going to happen in the next 30 years.
It is a talk about what is called <b>"postcapitalism"</b>.
It is a talk about how almost all jobs are going to disappear due to automation.
But also how we are going to think about this and come up with solutions.

Its a talk about the three big challenges we need to face.
And yes, this involves you as well!
