Your personal data is very valuable. Unfortunately you have less and less control over this data. Especially data about your health.
There are a number of large worldwide initiatives that suggest the idea to store this type of data in the cloud.
Not just of individuals, but on a national and even on European level. Meaning all citizens.
You don't have much choice. Hospitals, researchers, insurance companies and tech companies making the choice for you.
<p>
I believe users need a choice. Maybe you don't want your data in a cloud.
Maybe you want your data close and under your direct control. Allowing you to share want you think is ok.
A free, open and controllable box, compatible with those large initiatives, but where the user is in control of his/her own data.
I like to call this box the <b>Digital Personal Locker</b>. In this talk I'll explain what it is, why it's necessary and how you can join the initiative.
I also will show the technical design and hope for critical discussion with you about this! Feedback about what's missing or plain wrong is very very welcome.
<p>
Right now I'm gathering the people that are already doing something similar.
Think about the <a href="http://freedomboxfoundation.org/">Freedombox</a>, the <a href="https://www.whitebox.eu/">WhiteBox</a> and connecting these
people with organisations like the <a href="https://www.sidn.nl/">SIDN, the Dutch Tech Center for Life Sciences</a>, <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a> and a group of people who don't want their data stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Philips</a> - <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">SalesForce eHealth cloud</a> (yes you read that correctly, your health data in a US based cloud of a marketing company!).
<p>
Hope to see you at the presentation and please give feedback and be critical. We need to do this right, open and secure.
