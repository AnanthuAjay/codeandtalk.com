IT Architecture is not by definition high level and sometimes relevant details are of the utmost importance. Many proprietary tools exist for creating IT architectures. FOSS tools for creating architectures are still not commonly used. Also many architectures created are never exposed. In this way it is hard to learn from others. Maybe it is now time to promote open architectures. Maybe we should create more and better FOSS tools like microservices that helps us with creating the perfect FOSS architecture tool!
<p>
Outline of the talk:
<ul>
   <li>What is IT architecture?</li>
   <li>What are commonly used architecture methods?</li>
   <li>What is wrong with TOGAF and Archimate</li>
   <li>Do we need open architectures?</li>
   <li>FOSS alternatives for creating your (open) architecture</li>
   <li>Problems and challenges on the road for more Open Architectures.</li>
</ul>

After this talk everyone will have a better understanding between the difficult separation between architecture and software engineering. Also after this talk you will have a more complete view on available FOSS tools for creating architectures and will be more aware of the advantages of using FOSS tools for creating your architecture.",
