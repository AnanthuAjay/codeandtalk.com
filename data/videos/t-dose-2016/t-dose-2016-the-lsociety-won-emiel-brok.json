Open source\nhas changed how software is developed, how we work and collaborate together,\nhow fast and efficiently we can innovate, how business is modeled, etc.\n\nIf that fight is over, shall we all just stop caring? With the mass adoption\nof open source from proprietary legacy businesses to startups, there is\nstill often pressure to think of software licensing as the only way to get\nshort-term ROI.\n\nWe all have to keep making sure open source values are not being bent too\nstrong to benefit individuals or specific companies\u2019 agendas to the\ndetriment of general developers or users. Otherwise, we risk limited\ntechnical choices, reduced transparency, a lack of diversity and slow down\non innovation that is only possible with full openness.\n\nOne fight we still have to win...get schools to teach OSS!",
