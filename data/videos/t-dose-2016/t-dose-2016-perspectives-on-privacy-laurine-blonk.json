Recently there has been much attention to the different, far-reaching ways in which our privacy is being invaded. It is commonly referred to as a 'threat to our privacy'. However, this raises the question what exactly is being threatened \u2013 and many different claims are made in an attempt to address this, ranging from the importance of consumer control to political notions like freedom and democracy. There seems to be a lack of words to describe what is at stake, and a lack of consensus to defend it properly. This is highly problematic for both privacy activists and ordinary citizens.\n\nI will focus on the following questions: what is privacy and how do we refer to it? Is privacy a \u201cright\u201d, a private or public \u201cinterest\u201d or can we understand it as a new kind of currency (commodification of our personal data)? And what do these different notions mean for the way we perceive the 'threat'? Furthermore, I will compare the different notions of privacy and what these differences mean in the defense of our privacy. In other words: what could be a proper way to claim our right to privacy?\n\nLaurine Blonk presented and published her philosophical bachelor thesis on the topic of privacy as 'top level' undergraduate research at the Student Research Conference 2015 (www.studentresearchconference.nl).\nShe has work experience as a lecturer in philosophy and \u201clevensbeschouwing\u201d and also as a research assistant. Currently she is pursuing a masters degree in both Humanistic Studies (University for Humanistic Studies, Utrecht) and Philosophy (Erasmus University Rotterdam). She is a member of the NLLGG.",
