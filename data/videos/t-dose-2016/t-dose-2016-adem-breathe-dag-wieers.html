The aim of <a href="http://ik-adem.be/">the ADEM project</a> is to create a device that collects air pollution data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates">PM1.0 and PM2.5 fine dust</a>)
and is mounted on bicycles to crowd-source factual air pollution information in and around the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent, Belgium</a>.
The hardware and firmware design is modular and extendable. The device can be locally (re)produced and repaired.

<p>
During this presentation we will look at the hardware and firmware design. New ideas and future extensions. But we also touch on the problems related to particulate matter and air pollution. The device uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a> with various sensors and output devices. The firmware is written in C++ using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino framework</a>.
<p>

The project is Open Source, and completely run by volunteers. To evaluate this submission, more information is available from our project websites.
