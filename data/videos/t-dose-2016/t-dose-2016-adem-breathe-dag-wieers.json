The hardware and firmware design is modular and extendable. The device can be locally (re)produced and repaired.\n\nDuring this presentation we will look at the hardware and firmware design. New ideas and future extensions. But we also touch on the problems related to particulate matter and air pollution. The device uses an ESP8266 with various sensors and output devices. The firmware is written in C++ using the Arduino framework.\n\nThe project is Open Source, and completely run by volunteers. To evaluate this submission, more information is available from our project websites.\n\nProject website: http://ik-adem.be/\nGitHub project: https://github.com/timelab/ADEM\n\nAir quality information in Eindhoven: http://www.aireas.com/",
