This session will talk about how to integrate mentoring into all the different layers of an open source project. This involves a change in the whole community which treats new contributors with respect, knowing they have something valuable to contribute to the project.

<h2>Mentoring contributors to Drupal</h2>

  <li>Sprint days were mentoring events</li>
  <li>DrupalCon 3,000 people. Sprint Day 400 people. 16 mentors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IRC Mentoring offic houts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scheduled</li>
  <li>Dedicated time</li>
  <li>There is always an expereinced mentor there</li>
  <li>Once a week</li>
</ul>

There are two sessions, one for <b>new contributors</b> and one for <b>criticals</b>.
People can move from the former to the latter if they already know how to do one thing, eg. issue a pull-request.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/core-office-hours">Core contribution mentoring (core office hours)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Special features of the official mentoring hour on IRC:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide immediate feedback to work done by the contributors with directions how to improve that.</li>
  <li>New contributors feel supported, they get support from "big names" in the community.</li>
  <li>Same channel as the generic conversation, people can overhear other conversations and get involved.</li>
</ul>

In-person events are similar just more intense and more overhearing and more personal.
