    "description": "Recently browsers have been introduced with interesting tools for work with binary stream of data. Technologies like XHR2 and File API allow us to fetch binary blobs from urls and the file system, and from there, a whole new world is opened before us: we can use Media Source Extensions to implement live streaming audio/video protocols like DASH and HLS, WebRTC to transmit data P2P bittorrent style, WebGL to draw shapes from arrays of binary position data, and more. Furthermore, using technologies like asm.js and tools like Emscripten to transpile C++ code to JavaScript, we can do amazing things with all of the above, and achieve superior performance. In this talk we'll explore some of these techniques, and learn about how we are solving interesting problems with them.",
