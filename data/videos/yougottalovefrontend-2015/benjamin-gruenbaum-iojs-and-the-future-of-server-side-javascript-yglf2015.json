  "description": "io.js is a drop-in replacement for node.js and is compatible with nearly all the modules in npm. io.js is a community driven open source project. It was started by the primary contributors to node.js but in the first few months attracted more active developers than the node.js project has had in its entire history. In this talk we'll explore the new features of io.js through how they were contributed by the community. We'll go through my actual contribution process (from issue to specification to pull request to landing) of a feature and explore the new and upcoming features of backend and frontend JavaScript through open source contribution and show how to can get involved and why one should be involved.",
