    "description": "This talk will examine how we can set up Jenkins continuous build and delivery pipelines for mobile applications, with a focus on Android.\n\nTopics will include: \n* Automatically setting up Android-capable build agents\n\n* Ensuring traceability of application builds\n\n* Reporting on potential code problems\n\n* Running various types of tests, followed by deploying your app to Google Play \u2014 all with minimal effort.\n\nWith live demonstrations, we will see that this can be easier to set up than you might think. Getting your new features into the hands of testers and users should never be more than a Git push away!\n\nDelivered by Christopher Orr",
