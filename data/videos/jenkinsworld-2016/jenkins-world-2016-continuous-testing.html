This session is all about using best practices and test patterns within the Jenkins ecosystem.
We will integrate different types of test code into our Jenkins continuous integration strategy.
Then we will discuss test paradigms to drive testing with Jenkins, show how Jenkins does most of the heavy lifting in the testing process and demonstrate why Jenkins is a tool that needs to be in every tester's repertoire.
<p>
During this session, you will see a demonstration of how tests integrate within builds coupled with test reporters.
We will also review reporting, test coverage, and analysis of code and test feedback.
Finally, we will cover common pitfalls with tests (flakiness, retrying, thresholds and locking).
