As a release engineer in a company with several development teams, using several Jenkins instances comes in handy.
While this approach works fine in our company and gives the developers a lot of freedom, we came across some long-term problems concerning maintenance and standards.
Our problems were mostly caused by misconfiguration/non-usage of plugins.
With configuration as code in mind, I applied static code analysis with the help of SonarQube to all of our Jenkins job configurations.
