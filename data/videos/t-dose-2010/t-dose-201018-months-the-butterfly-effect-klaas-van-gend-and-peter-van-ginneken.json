    "description": "18 months The Butterfly Effect - what can an open source game achieve?\n\nAuthors: Klaas van Gend and Peter van Ginneken\n\nThis recording: We will briefly introduce the \"why\" of this open source, physics-based, interpretation of \"The Incredible Machine\"\n\nMay 2009, Peter and Klaas finally decided to make an open source version of the world-famous computer game \"The Incredible Machine\" (or TIM in short). Eighteen months have passed. We're well over a thousand commits in SVN. The game exists, has 40+ levels and is slowly gathering a community. Apart from discussing the programming of the game itself, this is a story of trial and error, looking at the competition, figuring out how to get publicity and a serious dose of \"what have we learned\".",
