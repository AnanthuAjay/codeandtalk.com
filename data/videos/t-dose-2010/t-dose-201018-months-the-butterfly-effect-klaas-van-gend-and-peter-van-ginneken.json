Eighteen months have passed. We're well over a thousand commits in SVN. The game exists, has 40+ levels and is slowly gathering a community. Apart from discussing the programming of the game itself, this is a story of trial and error, looking at the competition, figuring out how to get publicity and a serious dose of \"what have we learned\".\n\nMore at:\nhttp://www.t-dose.org/2010/talks/linux_games\n\nTechnical Dutch Open Source Event.\nNovember 7, 2010\nFontys Eindhoven.",
