  "description": "Kenneth Auchenberg speaks at Full Frontal 2013.\n\nWith the introduction of HTML5 the way we look at the browser has completely changed, but what has happen to our development workflow?\n\nIn this talk I take you through the history of web tooling and challenge the assumptions our current generation of tooling is build upon. You will realize that your web development workflow is completely broken, and that you over the years, have been making it gradually worse and more complex by adding more tools to the chain.\n\nIt's time to rethink our tooling.",
