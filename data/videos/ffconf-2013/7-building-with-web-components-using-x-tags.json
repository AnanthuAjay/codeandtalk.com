    "description": "Angelina Fabbro speaks at Full Frontal 2013.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll take a deep dive into how Web Components (A collection of technologies that includes Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, Custom Elements, and HTML Imports) can be used as building blocks to construct a functioning web application.\n\nWe'll review how each of the technologies under the web components umbrella work, how they work together, and how x-tags makes use of them to make modular, lightweight components. Special attention will be given to building applications for mobile devices with environments such as Firefox OS, Chrome OS, and PhoneGap.",
