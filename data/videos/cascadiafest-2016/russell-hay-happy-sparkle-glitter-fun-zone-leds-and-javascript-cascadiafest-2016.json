    "description": "This talk is about how, with a little bit of knowledge, a ton of RGB LEDs, and some low power computers, you can make amazing things. I will cover how to get yourself up and running quickly using Johnny-five + node-pixel on a small, low-cost, low-power device running javascript, and how to connect the board to outside sources to provide intelligent displays that can take data from the world, and turn it into a visualization on a strip of leds. I will show how to take a handful of LEDS, using johnny-five with the new i2c backpack for neo-pixels and make something flashy for your home, office, or a public space.",
