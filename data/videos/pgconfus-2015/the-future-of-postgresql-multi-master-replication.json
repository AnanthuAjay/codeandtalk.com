UDR shares most of the code and infrastructure with BDR and provides unidirectional logical replication for the cases where multimaster is not required.\n\nWe'll discuss:\n* What scenarios are good for asynchronous multimaster?\n* In which cases won't it work?\n* What methods exist to avoid and resolve conflicts?\n* Performance!\n* What's the relationship with core postgres?\n* The Future\n\nAbout the Speaker\nAndres Freund is a developer and consultant at 2ndQuadrant Ltd. He is developing and sometimes even using Postgres and other Open Source projects since 2005.
