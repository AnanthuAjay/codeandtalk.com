It gives some motivations for the immense growth in enterprise space PostgreSQL experienced in recent years. With PostgreSQL not only fulfilling the technical requirements, but also the operations requirements it quickly became a strategical choice for a lot of companies, be it for internal IT or one of the database systems of choice that are supported by their own product.\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\nMichael Meskes is President and CEO of the credativ Group, an industry leader in free software services with offices in five countries.
