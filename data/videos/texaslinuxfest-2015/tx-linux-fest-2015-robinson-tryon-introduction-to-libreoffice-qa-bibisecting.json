  "description": "One of the LibreOffice QA Team's most powerful tools for bug hunting is our collection of so-called \"bibisect\" repositories. Both experienced and new contributors to LibreOffice can leverage these tightly-compressed collections of hundreds of builds of LibreOffice to help identify the commit(s) that introduced a particular regression.\n\nThis talk will be interactive, so feel free to bring your laptop and follow along as we learn how to:\n - Reproduce bugs using the LibreOffice bibisect repositories\n - Track down bugs on different platforms\n - Perform cross-platform testing using VirtualBox",
