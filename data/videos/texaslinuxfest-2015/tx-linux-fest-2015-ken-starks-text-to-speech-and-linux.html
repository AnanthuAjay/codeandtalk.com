There's only one thing wrong with the Text to Speech options in the Linuxsphere. They suck. And it's not due to lack of trying by the various developers.
<p>
They work with the tools they have at the time they have them. But try as they may, the best that they can come up with is a cross between Cher and a constipated robot.
<p>
And to even get that into something audible entailed installing 3 different apps to achieve one line of speech.
<p>
I gave a 20 minute talk during LibrePlanet 2015 via text to speech but it was a closed solution and I had to purchase a $90.00 subscription just to do my talk at Cambridge.
<p>
The technology is out there, and from what I see within my circles, so is the talent. Tens of thousands of people like myself will depend on this software to make it through day to day living.
<p>
I want to find the people to make that happen. And yes, I will do it via text to speech. Oh, come on...It'll be fun.
