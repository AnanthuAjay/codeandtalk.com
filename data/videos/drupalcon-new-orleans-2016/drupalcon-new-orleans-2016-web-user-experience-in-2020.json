    "description": "The way people experience the web will see dramatic change in response to new tools, expectations and constraints in the coming years. This session will highlight some major forces shaping our medium and lead us in thinking about how we should expect to evolve what we deliver in light of changes in hardware, mobile, wearable, data, and software among others. We will look to parallels in architecture, aircraft and other technologies and suggest future trends that will evolve.   \n\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of the changing nature of our environment and the impact of all of these forces. Attendees will leave ready to make their own decisions about how best to embrace these forces in their own work.   \n\nSlides Link",
