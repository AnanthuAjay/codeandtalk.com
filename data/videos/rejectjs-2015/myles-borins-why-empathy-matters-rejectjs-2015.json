If you don\u2019t care about the people using your product, why are you making it? If you don\u2019t care about your co-workers who will have to use your code, why do you work with them? If you don\u2019t care about yourself, why are you doing this as a career?\n\nSome people may ask \u201cwhy empathy?\u201d. Let\u2019s examine this concept, find ways to be more empathetic in our actions, and discuss the pragmatism of empathy.\n\nThis talk will explore various ways in which developers can be more empathetic to the community, their co-workers, and themselves. The talk will also explore larger ways we as an industry can work together to improve empathy.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de",
