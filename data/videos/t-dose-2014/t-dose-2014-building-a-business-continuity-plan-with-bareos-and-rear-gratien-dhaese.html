Business Continuity (BC) Management is often confused with Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning as often BC steps are mentioned as part of a DR handbook. During this talk we will highlight what BC is all about and how to get started with it. Creating a DR Plan for certain key systems is only a small part of BC Management and as an example we will illustrate how a central backup server (using BAREOS backup software) plays an important role in DR scenarios of keys systems of your datacenter.

However, when the backup server itself is lost you need to foresee a recovery plan for it as well. To fill that gab you could use a disaster recovery tool such as Relax-and-Recover (rear) to restore the Bareos server from bare-metal.
