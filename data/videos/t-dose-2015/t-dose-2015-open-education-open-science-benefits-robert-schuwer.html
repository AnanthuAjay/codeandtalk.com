Open Education, Open Science and other forms of openness: can we benefit from each other?
<p>
In addition to open education, open access, open source software and open innovation, the open movement has also developed other varieties of "openness".
Although many types of "openness" exist, they are all based on the same basic principles.
What is meant by all these forms of openness? And should we strive to a more integrated approach when implementing these forms in real life situations?
In this talk I will focus on open education and open science and present how these forms of openness are influenced by other appearances of openness.
