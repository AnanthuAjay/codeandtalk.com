We give formal definition of the \u201cguessing attack\u201d, and\nthe \u201cattacker\u2019s strategy\u201d. The measure is based on the assessment of the efficiency of the best possible guessing\nattack. Unlike naive password strength assessments our measure takes into account the attacker\u2019s strategy. We\nargue strongly against widespread informal assumptions about \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d passwords, and advise to\nadopt formal metrics such as proposed one. This paper does NOT advise you to include \u201cat least three capital\nletters\u201d, seven underscores, and a number thirteen in your password.\n\nFull text of the paper is on arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05090\navailable as PDF and TeX.",
