Although many types of \u2018openness\u2019 exist, they are all based on the same basic principles. What is meant by all these forms of openness? And should we strive to a more integrated approach when implementing these forms in real life situations? In this talk I will focus on open education and open science and present how these forms of openness are influenced by other appearances of openness.",
