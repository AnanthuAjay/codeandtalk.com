I invite you on a journey of 30 years Free Software.
<p>
Together we celebrate 30 years of Free Software (FS) this year. In March 1985 Richard Stallman published his GNU manifesto.
Now 30 years later we look back on what has been achieved so far and what is to come.
How is your FS work more important now than ever? What has happened in the history of Free Software? How does this FS work present itself today? And why is your work so important for a Free society actually?
