  "description": "At the London Perl Workshop 2014 we demonstrated how to combine functional programming (for syntactic sugar) and a macro mechanism (for speed) to extend Perl in a \"smarter\" way.\n\nThat means with low investments, backwards compatibility and a strategic perspective to include the product into CORE after a sufficient testing phase.\n\nNow we want to present some hands-on examples demonstrating the realization of\n\n- Function Signatures\n- Meta Operators like functions\n- Compound Statements\n\nLast 10 minutes will be reserved for discussions.\n\nThe provided URLs for abstract and talk are from LPW 2014.",
