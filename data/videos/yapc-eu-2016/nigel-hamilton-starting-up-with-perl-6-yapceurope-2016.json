  "description": "Perl has powered startups for over 20 years. What can we learn from this rich history of dot bombs and dot coms?\n\nThis talk describes a start up process that I use to help ideas grow into new businesses. The audience will be asked to fill out a 'lean canvas' - one of the first steps in the process.\n\nThe talk includes a peek into the incubator - four startups at different stages of early growth.\n\nThe startups are powered by a lean start up engine written in Perl 5 and Perl 6. \n\nFind out how the APIs within the engine help learning, earning and serving. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6735",
