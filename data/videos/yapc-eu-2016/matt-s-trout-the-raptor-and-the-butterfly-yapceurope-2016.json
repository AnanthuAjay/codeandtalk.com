  "description": "So, rakudo is here for keeps, and 6.c has been finalised, and now we get to play.\n\nBetter still, there's both an Inline::Perl5 for rakudo, and an Inline::Perl6 for perl5.\n\nWhich means that perl5 can have access to grammars, and rakudo can have access to CPAN, and all sorts of fascinating possibilities unfold.\n\nBecause it turns out that with *two* perls at once, you get a lot more than twice as much rope. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6767",
