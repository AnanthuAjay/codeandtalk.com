    "description": "This talk introduces Weasel, a new webapp testing library shaped after - and improving on - php's Mink. With it's integration into Test::BDD::Cucumber (pherkin), extensibility and out-of-the-box features such as screenshot and test log recording, it makes for an easy to use platform for BDD style browser-based webapp testing. A spin-off from the LedgerSMB project.\n[ See https://github.com/perl-weasel ]",
