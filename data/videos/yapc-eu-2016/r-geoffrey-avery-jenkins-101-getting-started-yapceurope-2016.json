    "description": "Jenkins is a Continuous Integration tool to manage your environment that fires off jobs like cron or when a button is pushed. This talk will walk you through setting up a Jenkins site, complete with slave nodes on the servers doing the real work, and some simple jobs to get a feel for what it can do for you.\n\nReal life examples included based on an actual migration between data centers requiring Jenkins had to be installed fresh.",
