In this talk, we will show how we build microservices in Perl.
We will cover docker basics, the stack we use for creating, testing and releasing our internal Perl distributions and for creating, building and deploying our Perl microservices.
Let us reveal some details before the talk begins.
We use

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Minilla">Minilla</a> for scaffolding new distribution</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">Teamcity</a> for testing and building</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Pinto">Pinto</a> as our internal DarkPAN with MetaCPAN GUI</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for testing and packaging the microservices</li>
  <li><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a> / <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">Marathon</a> based internal cloud for running microservices in production</li>
</ul>

We will shortly describe each of mentioned technologies and how we use them together to build our continuous integration stack.
