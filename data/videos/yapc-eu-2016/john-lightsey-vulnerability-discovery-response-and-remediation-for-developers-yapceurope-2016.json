    "description": "Vulnerabilities are essentially bugs that some portion of the userbase will want to experience intentionally. As a result, the handling of \"vulnerabilities\" is very different from the handling of normal \"bugs\".\n\nThis talk will go over lessons learned while reporting vulnerabilities, responding to vulnerabilities, and deploying fixes for upstream vulnerabilities on the cPanel Security Team.\n\nAttendees should come away with a better understanding of the process from all sides.",
