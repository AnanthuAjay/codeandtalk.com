  "description": "We stopped to use ACT after the first Dancer conference in 2014 due to various failures and of course because using Dancer to shake a web site is way more fun. It was really a big relieve for us. We also intend to make the software behind it as general purpose tool for conferences. I share the features and technical solutions of the Perl Dancer Conference code in this presentation.\n\nOur Git repository: https://github.com/interchange/Perl-Dancer-Conference \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6780",
