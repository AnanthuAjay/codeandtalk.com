  "description": "With CSV being a dataformat that does not define the variables required to parse it (encoding, separator- and quotation character), we'd like to have features that wil (try to) do so for us automatically.\n\nHaving third party that ships CSV file sets that mix ';' and ',' for separators, UTF-8 and UTF-16LE files and more weirdness that makes one curse, caused me to write a new method that takes care of most of those annoyances.",
