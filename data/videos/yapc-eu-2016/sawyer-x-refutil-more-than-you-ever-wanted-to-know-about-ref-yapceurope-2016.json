  "description": "We all use ref($foo) eq $ref_type. It has two use-cases and it sucks for both.\n\nI wrote Ref::Util to address this. It's implemented in XS and as an op-code.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain why ref() is wrong, what Ref::Util does, how it works, and cover both how it's written in both XS and in interpreter op-codes.\n\nWe'll delve into internal Perl data types, XS, and operators. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6775",
