  "description": "Devel::QuickCover is a Perl module written in XS, which gathers run-time code coverage information with very little CPU and memory overhead, so it is perfectly possible to use it with production code. I will explain how the module is implemented, what you get when you use it and what you can do with that information. I will close by showing some examples of actual usage at the company I work for. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6818",
