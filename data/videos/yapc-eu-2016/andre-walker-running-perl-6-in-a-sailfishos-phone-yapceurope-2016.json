  "description": "Sailfish is a mobile operating system based on Linux and several open source components.\n\nI have been using it in my phone for a few months, and decided to try and write an app for it in Perl 6.\n\nIn this talk, I will show how I managed to cross compile rakudo to arm in the Sailfish SDK, made an initial implementation of the Qt5 bindings for Perl 6, and installed a demo Perl 6 application on my phone. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6840",
