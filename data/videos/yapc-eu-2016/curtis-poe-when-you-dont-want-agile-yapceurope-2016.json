  "description": "It's a little hard not to be perplexed by Agile proselytizers who intone the \"Agile is not a silver bullet\" mantra and then proceed to recommend it for everything. They're like developers who recommend Perl for everything and wonder why people don't take them seriously.\n\nLearn how to tell the proselytizers when to shove it.\n\nBy the time this talk is done, you'll understand what Agile is really about and when to use Agile, Lean, and Structured project management techniques. \n\nhttp://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6724",
