  "description": "For close to 10 years now, i have been working on my Maplat webserver, written in Perl. \n\nWell, when i say webserver, it evolved into much more. Its Front- and Backends run a big system at work (automotive supplier), my home air conditioner is controlled by it, so is my personal blog. My DNS runs on Maplat.\n\nOn Linuxdays in Graz it ran a distributed Genetic algorithm for Strandbeest legs with real-time visualization - on a Raspberry Pi cluster. I also used it to live-demo a Zero Day exploit on a popular webservice.\n\nIn this talk, i'll give an overview what Maplat is, how you can use it in your projects and how it will evolve in the future.",
