    "description": "Free Software Events in Europe [TEXT]\nThere are quite a few events on Free+Open Source Software in Europe by now. So many in fact, that you have to make a decision on which to attend. But what can you expect of those events? How many people will attend? What exactly happens on those events? What is the main focus there? And how does the place look like anyway? I will give some example of Germany and Autria, and a few of BeNeLux and France. I would like to encourage you to take a look at those events and participate - as an organizer, lecturer, helper at a booth - or simply as an auditor. Please come and exchange your ideas with the maintainers of the projects! Maybe some of the projects will find a translator for the documentation or a contact person in another country. \n\nMore at\nhttp://www.t-dose.org/2007/speakers",
