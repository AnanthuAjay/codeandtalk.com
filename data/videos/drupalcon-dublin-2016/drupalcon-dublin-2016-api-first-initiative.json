    "description": "We are working on making Drupal 8 truly API-first: API-first initative.\n\nWe are:\n\nImproving Drupal 8's REST API, to become usable (by 8.2.0) and then best-in-class (by 8.3.0).\nBringing JSON API support to Drupal 8 core (experimental in 8.3.0).\n\u2026 and there's so much more we'd like to see happen, such as: GraphQL, OAuth 2, UUID/revision support, CouchDB support.\u00a0\nIn doing so, we need:\n\nfrustrations!\u00a0to hear where Drupal 8's REST support in core (and contrib) is currently failing, in terms of DX, capabilities, and so on.\nroadmap feedback. (We need to hear what you think is important and why.)\nhelp!\u00a0We can provide mentoring: if you help out with patches, we'll provide reviews to help you land things in core!\n\n\nAt this core conversation:\n\nWe'll start with a succinct overview of what's going on, what has happened so far, and our long-term ambitions. Then we'll open the floor for discussion! When necessary, we'll explain subjects in more detail.\nYou don't need to be an expert in anything, just rudimentary knowledge about web services is sufficient.\nYou'll walk away knowing what's happening in the API-first initiative, and will hear about other attendees' concerns/thoughts/requirements/\u2026.",
