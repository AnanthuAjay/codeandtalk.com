    "description": "This session will provide a brief overview of the RDS service, how it achieves durability & high availability and then do a deep dive into the exciting new features that we have released. We will also explore what we have learned by managing a large fleet of PostgreSQL instances including possible gotchas around pg_upgrade, advice on replication tunables, vacuum settings and shared_buffers including changes introduced with 9.5.\n\nhttp://www.pgconf.us/2016/event/129/amazon-rds-for-postgresql-deep-dive-on-new-features-and-learnings/",
