    "description": "PostgreSQL is a great database - yet there is an interesting set of issues you encounter when you have a team of developers working with an ever changing schema.\n\nAt Product Hunt we've been using PostgreSQL as the main database since our launch in 2013 - and since then have encountered many smaller problems that we've had to deal with as we've grown, as well as making sure we get close to 100% uptime on our Postgres DB.\n\nThis session is about the lessons learned, and will go into issues like: Exclusive locks held during DB schema changes, making zero downtime schema changes, choosing what to index, problems encountered with Ruby on Rails and its use of prepared statements, and more.",
