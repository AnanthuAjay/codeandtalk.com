  "description": "How do we know PostgreSQL works? What do \"regression tests\", \"isolation tests\", \"TAP tests\" do? What does the build farm do? What is the community's role in testing? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the testing methodologies and tools and how can we improve them?\n\nI invite all existing hackers to join me so we can share our experiences and visions. For users who are not yet hackers, this presentation is a great way to learn about important development tools and practices of the PostgreSQL hacker community.\n\nhttp://www.pgconf.us/2016/event/123/how-postgresql-is-tested/",
