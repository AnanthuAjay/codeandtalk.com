  "description": "When new versions of Postgres are released most of the attention is focused on new features. Inevitably a release note claiming speed improvements seems relatively mundane and doesn't provide the compelling argument for upgrading.\n\nHowever the reality is that these speed improvements represent pain points that have been identified and solved.
