  "description": "I have been doing TDD for several years and of late, I have been left with the feeling that I am missing some key part of the value that it supposed to offer. This talk will cover some (not enough time for all) of the n00b mistakes I have made in the past, and I will try and present a TDD strategy that works for me and may help inform improvements in the way others approach their tests.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub",
