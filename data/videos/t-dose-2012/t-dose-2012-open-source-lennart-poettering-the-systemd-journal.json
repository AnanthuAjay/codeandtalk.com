It provides support for structured, indexed, robust, authenticated logging while integrating the multitude of system log sources we have into one. As it is a core component of systemd there might be a good chance you are already running it. In this talk I plan to give an overview on the Why?, the What? and the How? of the journal. I'll explain the technical background of systemd and provide you with a few examples how\nyou can make the journal work for you.\n\n27 and 28 October 2012 at the Fontys University of Applied Science in Eindhoven.",
