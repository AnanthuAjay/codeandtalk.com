For this reason the fight against spam and viruses is moving towards centralised anti-spam services that can use meaningful real-time statistics to recognise malicious content. Extensive use of techniques like honey-potting, statistical anomaly detection and cross-domain content analysis give these services a significant edge over stand-alone solutions in the market. The presentation will go into the advantages of several of these techniques and give insight in how they are used by Onlinespamfilter.\n\n27 and 28 October 2012 at the Fontys University of Applied Science in Eindhoven.",
