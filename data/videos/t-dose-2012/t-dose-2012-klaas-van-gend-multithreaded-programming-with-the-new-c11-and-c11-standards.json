Both standards finally add multithreading to the standard language and libraries, fortunately in an interoperable way. Especially the C++11 standard adds some really neat ways that change the way programmers will think about multithreaded code.\n\nKlaas will introduce the new features of both the C11 and C++11 languages and discuss how far gcc and clang are implementing the new standards.\n\nKlaas is very enthusiastic about the new versions of both programming languages - it will make his professional life a lot easier.\n\nWarning: this is a talk about updates to programming languages. Some people consider watching a still wet painting of growing grass to be more exciting.\n\n27 and 28 October 2012 at the Fontys University of Applied Science in Eindhoven.",
