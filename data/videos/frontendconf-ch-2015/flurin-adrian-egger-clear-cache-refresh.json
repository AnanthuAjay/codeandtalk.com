    "description": "It\u2019s 2015, yet many of us (both designers and web-developers) are still sticking to a process that hasn\u2019t changed since back when we were slicing PSD\u2019s in the nineties (remember that?). We are still making pretty pictures of websites before we make the actual websites. In doing so we lose a lot of ideas, expertise, and momentum. Let\u2019s change that.\n\nWe are two brothers who sit on different sides of the same industry. Adrian is a designer, and Flurin is a front-end developer. In this talk we\u2019ll explore designing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right in your browser. We\u2019ll explain why we think you should \u2014 and why your clients, your front-end developer colleagues, your fellow designers, and even your pets will love you for it.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not all unicorns and rainbows; but we hope to get you started nonetheless.",
