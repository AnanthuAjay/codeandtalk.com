    "description": "Our frontend team has been searching for a convenient way to create (and maintain!) scalable responsive web projects with a complex data structure. After trying some existing static site generators, we have spent a lot of time planning, developing, testing, rewriting, utilizing, and finally open-sourcing our own Gulp.js based setup.\n\nThis talk is about successes and failures, ongoing problems (looking at you, npm!) as well as responsibilities that come with open-sourcing.",
