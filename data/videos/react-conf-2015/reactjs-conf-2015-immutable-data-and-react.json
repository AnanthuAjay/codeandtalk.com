It's no accident that these are the the same benefits provided by React.\n\nPersistent data structures provide the benefits of immutability while maintaining high performance reads and writes and present a familiar API.\n\nLearn about how persistent immutable data structures work, and techniques for using them in your React applications with Immutable.js, a library of fully persistent immutable data structures.",
