    "description": "Dovecot\nSecure & flexible email server\n\nDovecot is a highly configurable open source email server, which expands into new areas all the time. This unfortunately makes Dovecot somewhat difficult to install if you don't already know everything about email servers. This talk first gives pointers on how to quickly and easily install your own secure mail server using Dovecot and Postfix. After that it touches on various interesting email related topics, such as how to store emails encrypted (e.g. with gpg), ways on how a government can spy on your mails and what might be done to prevent it.\n\nDownload video: http://videos.fscons.org/fscons/2013/c444_-_2013-11-09_1615_-_dovecot_-_timo_sirainen_-_48.ogv",
