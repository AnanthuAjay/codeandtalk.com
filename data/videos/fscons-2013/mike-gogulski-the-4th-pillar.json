    "description": "The 4th Pillar\nPeer-to-peer identity and reputation, beyond the state and beyond Bitcoin\n\nMy interpretation of cypherpunk utopia rests on four pillars:\n\n1: Secure messaging. We have that since the early 90s with PGP, etc. Mature.\n\n2: Anonymous messaging. We have that since the last 90s now with Tor. Mature but not widely deployed.\n\n3: Digital bearer currency. We have that now with Bitcoin and its derivatives. Low maturity but rapid innovation.\n\n4: Peer-to-peer identity and reputation. PGP and other systems provide web-of-trust models exist, but so far they don't scale.\n\nReputation and identity today are largely managed by centralized, largely unaccountable entities (states, corporation [think eBay and Equifax]) on the one hand, and by inefficient, low visibility peer networks on the other (old boys' clubs, word-of-mouth). \"Identity\", particularly, is centralized in states facing systematic dissolution.\n\nThe vision is for a decentralized, emergent consensus of reputation and identity. How to implement and live with it is our challenge.",
