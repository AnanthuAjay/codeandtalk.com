Projects like PRISM may have far-reaching implications for users of public cloud computing. Specifically, it could drive more users towards storage solutions that are hosted on own infrastructure.\n\nThis talk will discuss the problems of a future with centralized cloud file sync and share services and will present ownCloud as a possible solution.\n\nDownload video: http://videos.fscons.org/fscons/2013/c444_-_2013-11-09_1100_-_owncloud_-_frank_karlitscheck_-_50.ogv",
