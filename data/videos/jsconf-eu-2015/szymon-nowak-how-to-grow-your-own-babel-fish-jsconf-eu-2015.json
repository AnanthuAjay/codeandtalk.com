  "description": "In \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d the Babel fish is an animal, which \u201cif you stick one in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language\u201d. In this talk I\u2019ll show you how easy it is to write a web app that does exactly that. I\u2019ll also discuss some of the current Web Speech API limitations that hopefully will be removed in the near future to make the web even more powerful platform for real-time communication. And you won\u2019t have to stick anything into your ear!\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
