  "description": "The hardware world has historically been a mysterious, fragmented land of cryptic code. By leveraging the strengths of NodeJS, decade-old stagnant tools and libraries can be greatly improved when rewritten in JavaScript. Keeping this in mind, how do you even go about refactoring a fossilized piece of software while still preserving your sanity?\n\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll dig into an example of how you can create a modern, JavaScript-powered interface for users to program your device. You\u2019ll take away lessons on how to ensure the tools you create can deliver a delightful user experience to both end users and fellow developers. Preferably without bricking any microchips along the way!\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
