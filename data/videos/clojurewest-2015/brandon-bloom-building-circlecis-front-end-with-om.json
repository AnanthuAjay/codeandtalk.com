    "description": "CircleCI's frontend is a large, production-caliber, open-source Om project. CircleCI has long enjoyed the benefits of Clojure to power our CI platform, so we jumped at the opportunity to be ClojureScript + Om pioneers as well. Om represents both a significant step forward in UI development and considerable new opportunities for improvements. This talk will explore the benefits and challenges we've encountered, as well as provide a roadmap for using Om in your own projects.",
