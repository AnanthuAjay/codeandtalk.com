    "description": "www.angular-up.com\nBrought to you by 500Tech and the community\n@AngularUP\n\nAcross the universe - Server side rendering with Angular Universal - Nir Kaufman\n\nAngular 2 is designed to be agnostic about the runtime environment. This means that the same application can be deployed to different environments like browsers, servers or even native devices.\n\nIn this talk we will learn how to leverage this power using Angular Universal, and deploy our front-end SPA on the server without modification.\nWe will also learn how to avoid accessing environment specific functions, like direct DOM access, etc.",
