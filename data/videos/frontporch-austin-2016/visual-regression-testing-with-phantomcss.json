    "description": "Presenting speaker, Jon Bellah\n\nYou\u2019ve spent months perfecting your site; building your components and checking them twice. You\u2019ve gone through more QA than you can shake a stick at, and you\u2019re now completely change blind\u2026 but you\u2019re finally ready to launch that site!\n\nSuddenly, at the last minute, the client requires major changes to the a critical component (probably the legal department, it\u2019s always the legal department).\n\nYou make the changes and launch the site.\n\nBut wait, oh no! The client has reported some issues on a template you didn\u2019t think to check!\n\nIn the past, catching these visual regressions was a manual process. One where everyone is responsible for paying attention to what their code is doing and (hopefully) what else it may affect, with occasional passes through the site for overall QA. But we\u2019re human, mistakes happen\u2026 sometimes frequently.\n\nAutomated visual regression testing is an excellent way to build yourself a safety net. With PhantomCSS, you can create a test suite that automagically runs through your site after changes have been made, compares visual diffs, and alerts you of any changes.\n\nhttp://frontporch.io/resource/",
