  "description": "JSinSA 2016 conference - Johannesburg, South Africa \n\nAn annual gathering of JavaScript developers at the tip of Africa.\n\nTalk Summary:\nDespite the phenomenal popularity of web applications, there\u2019s still a need for desktop applications that fit a certain class of functionality. The fine folks at Github have developed a framework that allows developers the ability to build cross platform desktop applications using JavaScript. Join me as we take a whirlwind tour of Electron and discover what is possible today, on the desktop, using JavaScript. We've seen JS in the browser, and then on the server. Is it time for JS on the desktop?\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n%w{code politics culture design ux}.each { |thing| puts \"I\u2019m about #{thing}\" }\n\nVideo done by:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/William-Morrison-VideoPhotographer-1762126460674716/\n\nSponsored by Google Africa.",
