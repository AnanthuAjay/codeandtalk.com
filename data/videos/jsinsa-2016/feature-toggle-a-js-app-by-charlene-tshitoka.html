Whether it's a new button, new page or even route to new functionality, applications are all about features. We build them so they can be released in due time. But at times we need to integrate these features in the production codebase as early as possible. And toggles can help achieve that. Feature toggles provide a way to add functionality while retaining full control on when it should be activated. This way, applications can encapsulate features that will become visible to users once ready or even turned on for only a limited set of them. JavaScript applications can also take advantage of the many techniques of feature toggling. So, in this session I will demonstrate how to toggle one using redaction. We'll discuss the benefits of redaction-based features toggling, the testing strategies, and also some gotchas.
