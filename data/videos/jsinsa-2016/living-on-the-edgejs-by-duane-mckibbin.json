  "description": "JSinSA 2016 conference - Johannesburg, South Africa \n\nAn annual gathering of JavaScript developers at the tip of Africa.\n\nTalk Summary:\nJavaScript is really powerful and we can get a lot done in it, but sometimes we hit its limits and we need to jump into something else like .net. \nThanks to a library called edge.js, we can have both, I.e. call .net code from js and vice versa. \nI want to show how this works and take the attendees through a case where I implemented it in production.I'll give some practical advice as well as present a few gotchas to look out for.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDuane McKibbin is a software developer with 10 experience years working in various fields. \nHe started his career in Machine to machine communications (IOT before it was a buzzword) at Siemens as well as an electrical smart grid startup. \nDuane now works at Entelect Software as a Team Lead. He's currently based at Ashburton Investments but previously worked on various projects in various industries including medical aid, debt consolidation and imports. \nDuane has a real passion for web development, particularly front end JavaScript applications. He blogs at continuousdeveloper.com, mainly about CI and Continuous delivery. He loves to share his knowledge and learning with other developers and is always keen to learn something new. \nOn a more personal note, Duane is married and has an almost 2 year old daughter who keeps him very busy when not in the office.\n\nVideo done by:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/William-Morrison-VideoPhotographer-1762126460674716/\n\nSponsored by Google Africa.",
