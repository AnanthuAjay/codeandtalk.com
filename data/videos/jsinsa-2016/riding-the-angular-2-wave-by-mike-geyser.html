The imminent release of Angular 2 is poised like a tsunami, ready to take the World Wide Web by storm, and will inevitably drag the entire JavaScript ecosystem along for the ride.
Angular 2 sees itself less as a framework, and more as a platform on which to craft your single page applications.
This session will uncover the cornerstone of an angular application by illustrating the new web-component based design, improved dependency injection, and unidirectional data flow.
It will also demonstrate the routing model, templating and practical debugging.
Everything needed to kick start a project, and start riding the Angular 2 wave.

Speaker Bio:
<p>
Mike Geyser is a programmer at BBD, specialising in designing and building for the web platform.
He's been hacking on the web since geocities was a thing, has a long-lived love affair with javascript, and has (almost) come to terms with the fact that he will never have a programmer beard.
While he has worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeals to him - having earned his stripes on high volume transactional websites.
He works primarily in javascript, C# and (unfortunately) java, and seldom refers to himself in the third person.
