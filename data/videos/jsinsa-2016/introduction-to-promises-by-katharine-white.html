In this talk, I will introduce the concept of promises, and discuss when and how they are useful.
I will then demo an example of how I've used them to get rid of messy chains of call-backs and produce something much cleaner.
<p>
I will also demo a way of using promises, generators, let and for-of, all of which were introduced ES6, to provide an elegant way to chain asynchronous methods in a synchronous way.
<p>
<q>Promises to help avoid callback hell.</q>
