JavaScript is really powerful and we can get a lot done in it, but sometimes we hit its limits and we need to jump into something else like .net.
<p>
Thanks to a library called <a href="http://tjanczuk.github.io/edge/">edge.js</a>, we can have both, I.e. call .net code from js and vice versa.
<p>
I want to show how this works and take the attendees through a case where I implemented it in production.I'll give some practical advice as well as present a few gotchas to look out for.
