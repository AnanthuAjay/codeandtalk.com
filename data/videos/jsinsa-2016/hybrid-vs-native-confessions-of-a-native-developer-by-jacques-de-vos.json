  "description": "JSinSA 2016 conference - Johannesburg, South Africa \n\nAn annual gathering of JavaScript developers at the tip of Africa.\n\nTalk Summary:\nChoosing the wrong mobile tech stack sets you up for a world of pain. But how do you select the right one from a plethora of current options? \nAs an iOS developer I am convinced that a carefully designed native app provides the best user experience. So why would we choose Ionic2/Angular2 on Cordova (a bleeding edge Hybrid JavaScript framework) for our latest mobile App? In this short talk I will share our thinking and experiences on the current landscape of mobile stack options. \nI will introduce the contenders: Native (iOS and Android) vs Semi-Native (Xamarin and React Native) vs Hybrid (Ionic2/Angular2 on Cordova) vs Web. We will then go through some of the prominent tradeoffs between the different options: cost, reuse, single language, speed and user experience, device support, learning curve. \nThis should give you some (opinionated) guidelines to choosing the right mobile stack for your particular App.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nI'm a software engineer who divides my time between coaching software development teams and building software products, mostly mobile. Most of my experience has been in developing crucial font-end applications in the financial industries: online trading, online banking, insurance and branch banking.\n\nVideo done by:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/William-Morrison-VideoPhotographer-1762126460674716/\n\nSponsored by Google Africa.",
