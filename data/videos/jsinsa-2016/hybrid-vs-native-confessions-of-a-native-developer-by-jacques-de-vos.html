Choosing the wrong mobile tech stack sets you up for a world of pain. But how do you select the right one from a plethora of current options?
<p>
As an iOS developer I am convinced that a carefully designed native app provides the best user experience.
So why would we choose Ionic2/Angular2 on Cordova (a bleeding edge Hybrid JavaScript framework) for our latest mobile App?
In this short talk I will share our thinking and experiences on the current landscape of mobile stack options. 
<p>
I will introduce the contenders: Native (iOS and Android) vs Semi-Native (<a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>)
vs Hybrid (<a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic2</a>/<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular2</a> on <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>) vs Web.
We will then go through some of the prominent tradeoffs between the different options: cost, reuse, single language, speed and user experience, device support, learning curve.
<p>
This should give you some (opinionated) guidelines to choosing the right mobile stack for your particular App.
