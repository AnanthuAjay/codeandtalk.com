  "description": "JSinSA 2016 conference - Johannesburg, South Africa \n\nAn annual gathering of JavaScript developers at the tip of Africa.\n\nTalk Summary:\nBB-8 by Sphero is a bluetooth enabled droid based on the character from the new Star Wars movie. BB-8 can be controlled from an app on your phone via bluetooth, however using cylon.js you can take full control of your droid. I would like to show you how easy it is to turn your droid into the coolest droid in the galaxy.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nI am a software developer based in Johannesburg and working at BBD. I have worked in the software development field for over five years on various projects involving .NET, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS and more recently MeteorJS. Front end development has always been what I enjoyed doing most and I have recently become involved in UX and design as well. My interest in robotics increased recently when I started spending my weekends hacking my Star Wars droid.\n\nVideo done by:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/William-Morrison-VideoPhotographer-1762126460674716/\n\nSponsored by Google Africa.",
