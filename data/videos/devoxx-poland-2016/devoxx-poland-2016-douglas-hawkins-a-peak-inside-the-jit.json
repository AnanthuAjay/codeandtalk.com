    "description": "To get the most of out our applications and ourselves as developers, we must strive to understand our tools -- compilers included. Unfortunately, modern optimizing compilers are complex systems and understanding them can be a challenge. And, understanding the just-in-time speculative optimizing compilers inside JVMs can be even more daunting.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about and see demos of many of OpenJDK's optimizations . By seeing these optimizations in action and more importantly learning how these optimizations fit together, you'll learn how to work with the JIT to make your code and you more efficient.",
