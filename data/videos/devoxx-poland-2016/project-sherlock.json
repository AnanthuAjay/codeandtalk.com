    "description": "Stephan Janssen talks about the launch of Project Sherlock, an open source initiative launched by Devoxx, Voxxed and IBM. Sherlock is about building a new way for developers to discover knowledge and answers to their most vexing questions. \n\nInitially using IBM Watson, the project aims to use AI, machine learning and other technologies to build a discoverable knowledge base. This will ultimately be contextually searchable and deliver specific, expert answers in real time to questions facing the working developer.",
