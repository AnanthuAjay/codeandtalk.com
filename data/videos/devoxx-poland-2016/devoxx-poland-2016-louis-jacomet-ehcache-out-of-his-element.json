    "description": "Ehcache 3 offers major API changes. Apart from the JSR-107 compatibility, everything has been updated to make it a library convenient to use while offering advanced configuration options.\n\nAnd one of the major changes is the removal of the Element!\n\nStarting from JSR-107 support in well-known frameworks like Spring, we will show how easy it is to integrate Ehcache 3 in your application.\n\nFrom there, simply through configuration, you will see how to leverage the additional features that Ehcache brings. It will allow us to demonstrate the patterns used in Ehcache 3 to simplify it.\n\nAnd to finish, we will look at the mandatory XML which allows to break all compile time dependency on Ehcache 3 in a JSR-107 context while leveraging the extra features.",
