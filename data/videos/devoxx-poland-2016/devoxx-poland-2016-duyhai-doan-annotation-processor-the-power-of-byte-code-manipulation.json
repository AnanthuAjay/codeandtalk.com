    "description": "Most Java programmers know that byte code manipulation enable advanced features of Java like source code generation, automatic accessors creation, transparent proxies etc ...\n\nThe power of byte code comes with its drawback e.g. the inherent complexity of the byte code language itself.\n\nBut few people think about Annotation Processing that allows arbitrary code generation at compile time and enables a complete type safe code.\n\nWe'll demonstrate this feature with a simple sample using JavaPoet and Google Compile Testing libraries",
