    "description": "The way software is developed and run in production has changed dramatically over the past ten years. These changes are just now reaching the \u201cmainstream\u201d who are looking to respond to the idea that \u201csoftware is eating the world\u201d and use software like all the \u201cunicorns\u201d we read about in the market. Getting your advice strictly from unicorn companies can feel a lot like getting dieting advice from celebrities: it sure will work if you have unlimited resources, few constraints, and, well, are already successful. What can the rest of shlubs who actually work in \u201cthe real world do\u201d to get closer to the benefits of being \u201ccloud native\u201d?\n\nThis talk answers that question by looking at the current state of IT and how the role of IT has changed in recent years: if around \u2154 of businesses think IT doesn\u2019t help them innovate, how is IT going to be effective in an era where custom written software is key to surviving and thriving in a business world where competitive advantages are now highly transient?",
