    "description": "Some people use the cloud. Others build one. This talk will be about building your own enteprise cloud.\nWhen running a cloud 3 things are important: scaling, easy (cost effective) maintenance, and stability. These 3 points are very closely related through one subject: automation. Thanks to the easy automation tools like pxe boot (for booting a new setup) and puppet (for configuring a new system) setting up a new server was never this easy. But how can we use these tools to create a scalable infrastructure that is cost effective, stable and easy to maintain?\nIn this talk you will learn about how to design a scalable secure architecture and how to make the right tools work for you without going into to much detail.",
