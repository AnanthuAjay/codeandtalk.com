    "description": "The web has changed drastically the last few years. The browser is becoming the de-facto application platform for online cooperation. To accommodate this, applications need to be able to scale up and down dynamically as the number of users fluctuates.

Furthermore, the continuous need to innovate stresses the importance of extensibility and maintainability of these applications.",
