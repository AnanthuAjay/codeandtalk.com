In this talk we'll explore how to identify performance issues using perf, and how to take these bottlenecks away. We'll discuss prefetching (both hardware and software), conditional execution, and how we can use the compiler to help us. Finally, we'll do an analysis of the resulting improvements using both simulations and actual RTL.\nInfo at:\nhttp://www.t-dose.org/2013/talks/fighting-latency-how-optimize-your-system-using-perf",
