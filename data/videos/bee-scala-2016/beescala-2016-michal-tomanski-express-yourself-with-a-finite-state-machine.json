    "description": "This talk was recorded at BeeScala 2016 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk I will introduce you to the concept of a finite-state machine. Why is it worth to be used? It allows the developer to design and code a process manager in a very simple and expressive way. We will see a real life example of a business process implemented with it. We will also make the process fail-proof by using persistence. All of it will be done using Akka Persistence.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/michaltomanski\nhttp://github.com/michaltomanski/fsm-demo\nhttp://slides.com/michaltomanski/fsm",
