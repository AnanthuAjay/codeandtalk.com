Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nEvolutionary algorithms open windows to where machines and biology meet. In this talk we\u2019ll explore how evolutionary algorithms mimic and borrow from the way that Mother Nature solves problems \u2013 the road, from solving puzzles, to social sciences, to designing new kinds of satellite antennas. We\u2019ll see how we can use plain Scala to code evolutionary algorithms, and see the existing libraries that can help us save some time.",
