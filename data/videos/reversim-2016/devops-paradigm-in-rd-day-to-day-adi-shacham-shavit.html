It all starts with working together.
The term "DevOps" holds much more than just a new job description for operation people.
For us, it is a way of life.
We create our own flavour of DevOps organization, including system ownership, combined teams, tools and much more. 
This will be our chance to share our good experience about how it can actually be done and why it might be good for you, your DevOps team and your business.
