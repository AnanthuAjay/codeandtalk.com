Static Analysis is a very effective tool to improve code quality. Integrate it into the code life cycle requires both your cultural and technical attention.

In this talk I will show horrific examples of what we have found in our code base, and the process we did taking FindBugs from a P.O.C into a one of the main pillar of our Immune System.

Immune System:
<ul>
Â  <li>Unit test</li>
  <li>Self test</li>
  <li>Integration test</li>
  <li>Production test</li>
  <li>Alerts</li>
  <li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
