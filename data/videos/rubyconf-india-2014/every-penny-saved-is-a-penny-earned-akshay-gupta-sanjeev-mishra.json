  "description": "As rubyist, what has been increasingly difficult is to find out where our code went wrong. As programmers there are studies which indicate that we spent 60% of our time debugging and trying to find an answer to these questions. That's like \"more than half of the time\". What if we could reduce this wasted time? After all, every penny (second) saved it a penny (second) earned.\n\nFortunately, we do have tools which have made it possible to make it not only fast and easy but fun too. One such tool is PRY. The stats show that PRY has been downloaded million times (~4.8M) already. So we think it makes a lot of sense to explore why people are using it. Still there still is a larger group of rubyists out there who probably are not using PRY; not because they don't want to but because either they do not know that such a tool exists or because they don't know what ALL it can do to.\n\nIn this talk, we will be talking and doing some hands on with PRY and its plugins to showcase how we can speed up development by reducing the debugging time.",
