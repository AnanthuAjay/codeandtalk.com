TODO
-----
* For older events: are the videos available online?

* Include logo of each event?
* Improved UI!

* Create separate Twitter account for the site.
* Change the sitemap.xml creating code to use the date of the files for real date.

* Videos: improve how they are collected (date, speaker, youtube code, length?)
* Videos: describe how to add them
* Add tags to videos for better indexing
* Combine the speakers page with the xcast people
* Add JavaScript based searching for videos.

* Create event "series" e.g. all the 'frontporch' events.
* Weekly Newsletter with information about events.
  The subscriber should be able to select filter by countries and/or by topics.
  The e-mail itself is an HTML message that we can also build on the website.

* Add Facebook image code to video pages
* Improve the UI of the web site, look at what pyvideo has nice.
  Font Awesome
* Link from event to other events in the series.

* Another potential use of the data: Help conference and meetup organizers find potential speakers.
* List people by location (city, state, country)
* List people by subjects (tags for which they spoke)

* For sitemap of the collection pages, use the timestamp of the most recent event in that list.
* For sitemap of videos, use the date of the file.

* Add "language" field to the videos and allow the user to filter the results to selected language(s). (There are talk in French, German, Spanish, etc.)
